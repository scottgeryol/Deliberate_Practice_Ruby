golf?

Hey Peter -

Some of my hobbies are cooking, trying different craft beers, and golf. Here's where I'm at with my Capstone Ideas. 
1. A coooking app where the user can enter ingredients that they currnetly have in their home, and returns possible recipies with what they have available. Assuming thne user wont already have everyhing in the recipe, it will also return what grpcery items are needed to complete the dish.
2. A beer menus app (it acutally exists, but isn't that great) where the user can look up current tap lists/bottle selections different bars, restuarants, and breweries have. A way to forsee and plan where to go out nad try new/good beers. Main con would be it requires the establishment to update their inventory.
3. Something golf realted? Maybe show course layouts, individual holes, score card with ability to keep score. GPS for yardage on individual shots?
