# puts "You entered #{word.upcase} in all CAPS"

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# puts "Please enter a number:"
# number = gets.chomp
# if number.to_i > 100
#   puts "That's a big number."
# else
#   puts "Thank you."
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# puts "Please enter a number:"
# number_1 = gets.chomp
# puts "Please enter another number:"
# number_2 = gets.chomp
# puts "Your total is:"
# p number_1.to_i + number_2.to_i

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# puts "Please enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# puts "Enter a number:"
# number = gets.chomp
# p number.to_i * 10

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# word_1 = gets.chomp
# puts "Enter another word:"
# word_2 = gets.chomp
# puts "#{word_1.capitalize} #{word_2.capitalize}"

# puts word.length

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# puts "Enter a number:"
# number = gets.chomp
# if number.to_i < 0
#   puts "That's a negative number."
# end

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# puts "Enter a numner:"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts "Enter another number:"
# number_2 = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts number * number_2

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

# puts "Enter a word:"
